Even if you specify a specific version of a package in your `environment.yml`, the way its dependencies get resolved may differ in their versions. Other approaches to virtual environments have **lockfiles** that ensure that the environment is completely reproducible (eg. `pipenv`). This is the **right way** to handle such things, and we are hoping conda catches up quickly.\n"
