NOTE: By default, raw data is installed and unpacked in the `data` directory
If you are working with big data (or have a small disk partition), it is
HIGHLY recommended that you move this directory elsewhere; i.e. either
move it and leave a symlink behind, or modify the `raw_data_path`, `interim_data_path`,
and/or `processed_data_path` paths in {{ cookiecutter.module_name }}/paths.py accordingly

You have been warned.
